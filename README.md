Frontend Nanodegree Arcade Game
===============================

This is my 4th Udacity project. A JavaScript arcade game based on the original Frogger arcade game.

### You can play the game one of two ways:

* Play the game on your browser by going to this
 [link.](https://eqdeveloper.github.io/arcade-game/.)

* Clone repository and run index.html on your http://localhost:8000/ server. [(link to repository)](https://github.com/eqDeveloper/arcade-game)


### Objective:

Get the player to the water without being hit by a bug using the **Left**, **Right**, **Up** and **Down** buttons on your keyboard.
